# sign_language_interpreter
A lot of people among us do not have the ability to communicate with people by speaking. For these differently abled people there is a language called ASL (American Sign Language). But the problem is, even if some people know the signs, most of us do not know how to communicate to them with ASL. So, we proposed a design of a glove which can sense the Sign and interpret that in English, so that it becomes clear to people who do not understand sign language.
